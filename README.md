Ex1 - Base Arithmetic Converter  
================================  
This is my first GitHub project, created as part of an assignment (Ex1) for Ariel University, 2025.  

About Me

Hi! I'm Itiel Halevi, a student at Ariel University. First year with a passion for success.

Introduction  
------------  
This program processes numbers in different bases, performs addition and multiplication, and outputs the results in a specified base. It also finds the largest number among inputs and results.  

Example Usage  
-------------  
Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program):  
1223bB  
1223bB is number: true, value = 1598  

Enter a string as number#2 (or "quit" to end the program):  
14  
14 is number: true, value = 14  

Enter a base for output - [2,16]:  
7  
1223bB + 14 = 4462b7  
1223bB * 14 = 122140b7  
Max number over [1223bB, 14, 4462b7, 122140b7] is: 122140b7
